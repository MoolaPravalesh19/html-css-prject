    <h1>PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <P>Personality development is a process where you work on yourself to nurture your talents and add new skills to
        your arsenal. None of us is born with the ability to excel in various fields; however, experience and training
        prepare us to use our talents. Personality development is a part of skill development as it prepares you to
        express your thoughts with clarity and precision.Personality development is essential for you to present
        yourself to the world. A good personality is what any employer or interviewer first notices during an
        interaction with you. Working on your personality development skills is a dynamic process, and you master it as
        you learn more about it. </P>
